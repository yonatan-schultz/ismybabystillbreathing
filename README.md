Are YOU an anxious parent? Do you find yourself checking on your child multiple times a night just to make sure they're still breathing? Do you often wake them up accidentally when checking, costing both you and them precious sleep? Well, worry no more! 

Is My Baby Still Breathing is a simple application that checks to see if your baby is breathing. And to prevent unecessary panic, even when it might LOOK like they're not breathing it reminds you that they are, indeed, breathing. To calm the fuck down!
